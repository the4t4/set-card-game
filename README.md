# SET Card Game
## Rules
The goal of the game is to find SETs of three cards from the twelve cards placed on the desk. All cards have four properties:

* SHAPE: oval, squiggle, diamond
* COLOR: red, green, purlple
* NUMBER: 1,2, or 3 shapes
* SHADING: solid, striped or outlined shapes (only used in the subtasks for bonus points)

Every SET consists of three cards, where all properties are:

* the same on all of the cards
* different on all of the cards

The selected cards have to adhere to these rules for ALL properties. Worded differently: if the three cards have the same number of shapes, or 1 2 and 3; if the color is the same, or all three colors; if all shapes are solid, or one solid, striped and empty, etc...
